# Optical-Phenomena

A graduation project that explores the optical phenomenon of causticsâ€”the formation of light patterns resulting from the intersection of a beam of light rays. The program simulates scenarios of ray reflection from parabolic surfaces.
The program code is written in the C# programming language, and the interface is implemented using Windows Forms.

Further, you can view the charts generated by the program and examples of this optical phenomenon occurring in real life.
